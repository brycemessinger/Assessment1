let planning = `Finding out the scope of the problem(s) and determine what will be the best solutions.`
let analysisOfRequirements = `Analyze needs of user base and ensure the application, website, etc will meet those needs. This is also the step where the developer(s) consider the functional requirements of the project.`
let design = `detailed outline of required specifications, features, and code needed to complete the project. Something like a flowchart or roadmap is ironed out here.`

let testingAndIntegration = `After developers have created the code, it is passed to quality assurance team members for corrections or needed changes before being integrated into the stack and pushed out as a completed product.`
let maintain = `While the product has been pushed out to it's target audience, it may be fine tuned and updated with new features, and needs updates to fix bugs where needed.`
